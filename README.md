# Project Name :- Advanced Regression -Housing market entry assignement
> Problem Statement:
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. Company purchase the house at lower price and flip at higher price. Company uses data analytics for this purpose. It has collected house price in Australia and provide it in .csv file. Need to build a regresion model using regularization to predict actual house price

Essentially, the company wants â€”

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and.

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

>  Business Goal
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
- House price and details house sold in Australia
-  Business Goal : 
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
- Ridge alpha value is : 2 
- Lasso alpha value is : 0.003
- When alpha values are doubled, no major change in R2 and SME values. Most critical predicor variables remain same
- Lasso allows feature selection, hence it take more edge over Ridge regresson
